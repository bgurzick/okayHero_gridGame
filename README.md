Playing the Game:

- The game starts with a 5-second countdown timer. You must either find the "HOT PINK" square or avoid all "NO ACCESS" squares within this time limit.

- If you hover over all "NO ACCESS" squares or the timer reaches 5 seconds without finding the "HOT PINK" square, the game ends.



Still in progress:

- Adding a restart option when the player wins; currently there is only a restart option when the player loses

- Rendering all squares a color when the player wins; currently all squares are rendered black when a player loses;
